<h1>GERP Money Purchase Analysis for Tier 2 Participants</h1>

<h2>History of the Money Purchase Benefit</h2>

<p>Date of implementation 1996, 1997</p>

<p>Deferred Vested Participants where the most likely to get a money purchase calculated benefits.</p>

<p>Actuarial view of discretionary assumptions.</p>

<h2>Aspects of the creation of Tier 2</h2>

<p>Pension plans in 2008 were going to court to reduce the cost-of-living increases.  We did not think that would be, or, honestly, should be, successful.Staff's view was that a cost-of-living adjustment is an important part of a promised, contractual, benefit.</p>

<p>To avoid legal issues, and to bring down pension liabilities, the cost-of-living adjustment on the Tier 2 Regular Benefit became discretionary, unlike the Regular Benefit for Tier 1 participants.</p>

<p>This change provides a way for a future board to reduce liabilies by having a policy to not increase the benefit.  Members of this Board has expressed some concern that the increase is not tied to an outside measure of interest rates.  I think that the function of it being discretionary must not be compromised. The Board must contemplate this difficult decision every year.</p>

<h2>Valuation Assumption vs Money Purchase Assumption</h2>


<h2>The Problem with the Tier 2 Defined Benefit</h2>

<p>Effectively a pure money purchase plan for early retirements.  Discuss the end of career issues with a pure money purchase plan.  Year/Year increase in benefits make it very difficult to retire.</p>

<h2>Adding a return assumption to the Tier 2 - date of change</h2>

<h2>Some proposed solutions.</h2>

<h3>Fix the cost-of-living increases for money purchase benefit recipients to be constant</h3>

<p>This may be unfair to defined benefit recipients if the CPI based cost-of-living lags.</p>

<h3>Constant cost-of-living increase for everyone.</h3>

<p>Not the ideal time to try that.</p>
